# Daily Auto Commit Bot  

This repository contains a fun little project that utilizes GitHub Actions to automatically commit changes to the repository every day. It's a light-hearted experiment to explore the capabilities of GitHub Actions and keep the repository active without manual intervention.  

## Features  

- **Daily Commits**: Automatically generates and pushes a commit every day.  
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Powered by a simple workflow configured using GitHub Actions.  
- **Customizable Messages**: Includes a sample commit message that can be modified to your liking.  

## How It Works  

1. The project uses a GitHub Actions workflow triggered by a scheduled event (`cron`).  
2. The workflow runs a simple script that modifies a file (e.g., updates a timestamp) and commits the change.  
3. The commit is then pushed to the repository automatically.  

## Getting Started  

To set up this project in your repository:  

1. Clone this repository or copy the configuration files into your repository.  
2. Select the **Actions** tab on your GitHub repository. Run the workflow located in the `.github/workflows/auto-commit.yml` folder. Make sure the target branch is `main`.
